% This file contains the abstract of the thesis

The purpose of this thesis is to create an online framework that helps players of the popular scifi video game, EVE Online, with one of the most crucial aspects of the game: designing  ship fittings. Building on top of a community-developed fitting engine, this project will support the simulation of numerous combinations of ships and modules. Users will be able to use the framework to create and share fits, and 3rd party developers will be able to use the provided APIs to enhance their services.
